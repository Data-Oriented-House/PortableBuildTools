# PortableBuildTools

Portable, simple and fast installer for Visual Studio Build Tools.

Downloads standalone 64-bit MSVC compiler, linker & other tools, also headers/libraries from Windows SDK,
into a portable folder, without installing Visual Studio.
Has only bare minimum components - no UWP/Store/WindowsRT stuff,
just files & tools for 64-bit native desktop app development.
