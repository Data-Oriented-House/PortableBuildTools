## TODO

* Rework the entire GUI completely by someone who know how it works, with screen scaling support, like wcap.
* After clicking install, check if desired directory exists and is non-empty, if it is - display a message box saying "Desired directory is not empty."
* Indicate somehow when invalid path name is set?
* Cancel console autoscroll? Possible? EM_GETSCROLLPOS maybe?
